# bibtex-js-es6

Imported from http://code.google.com/p/bibtex-js/ by Hendik Muehe.

Searching for a bibtex parser, I found this library on google code. Since
google code will shut down within a few months, I decided to export it to
github. I also converted it to es6. But after testing it a bit I don't think
this is the right library my use case.

The project was listed MIT licensed, this one is too.
